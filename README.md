 Code solutions for 2022 Advent of Code

## Opening Remarks

It's that time of year again. I can tell you how it will go:
1. First few days: puzzles are done too quickly. I will start doing them in multiple languages just for fun.
2. Middle days: taking me long enough to do the puzzles that I limit myself to only my primary solving language.
3. End days: will have go to the [solutions megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/solution_megathreads/) on Reddit at least twice, and some puzzles will take more than a day to complete. Life will suck.
4. Christmas: drinking eggnog while summoning the courage to revisit the puzzles I couldn't solve.

But seriously. In 2020 and 2021 I solved in Swift, with 2021's focus being on using Swift Algorithms wherever possible. This year, I'm switching to Perl. In the off-season, I re-solved all of the 2021 puzzles in Perl and was surprised at how much fun I had doing it. Perl is the first language that I mastered (back in the mid-90's) and you never forget your first love.

If I run into problems, especially with complex data structures and/or the lack of debugging tools, I may revert to Swift. I expect that in the early "multiple languages" phase, I will be playing with Swift, Pascal and maybe even PHP.
